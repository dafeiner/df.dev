## Build Setup

**I messed up with installing the app and everything is contained within the `app` directory but would prefer to have it all be in the root directory eventually.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
